Exercise 13
1. Create a `gymStatus` method in `game` to tally completed and incomplete gyms.

This method should:
  - Not accept any arguments.
  - Initially create a constant `gymTally`, which is an object that has two 
    properties: `completed` and `incomplete`, both of which are initially set to 0.
  - Iterate through the objects in the `game.gyms` array and update the 
    properties on `gymTally` as follows: 
    - `completed` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of `true` 
      for their `completed` property. 
    - `incomplete` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of 
      `false` for their `completed` property.
  - Log the value of `gymTally`.
  - The method should not return anything.

For example, if five gym objects have a value of `true` on their `completed` property and three gym objects have a value of `false` on their `completed` property, the logged value would be: `{ completed: 5, incomplete: 3 }`.
